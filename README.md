# 🚂 [HSR-Backup] - MMD Index

The code, structure, and documentation of this repository are licensed under the [MIT License](LINK PARA O SEU ARQUIVO LICENSE) and are the independent creation of the repository owner.

I couldn't get the index to display correctly via GitHub Pages, so **you must download the entire repository** to view the content. I will continue working on making it accessible via Pages soon.

**Note:** I will not include all character audio assets due to file size and copyright concerns. I will only focus on audio for collaborative projects (collabs).
